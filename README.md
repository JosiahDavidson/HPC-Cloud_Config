# HPC-Cloud_Config
This repo contains a bunch of little scripts, configuration files, &amp; write-ups/instructions for deploying different environments to the cloud. These are primarily development environments, but it's also a nice little note-keeping repo so I don't forget my configs.

There't not a real reason to protect personal configuration right now, so hopefully it helps. Have fun!
